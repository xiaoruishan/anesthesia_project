function [T nPar dimPar]=transferEntropyPartition(X,Y,t,w)

%%%%%
% This function computes the transfer entropy between time series X and Y,
% with the flow of information directed from X to Y. Probability density
% estimation is based on the Darbellay-Vajda partitioning algorithm.
% 
% For details, please see T Schreiber, "Measuring information transfer", Physical Review Letters, 85(2):461-464, 2000.
%
% Inputs:
% X: source time series in 1-D vector
% Y: target time series in 1-D vector
% t: time lag in X from present
% w: time lag in Y from present
%
% Outputs:
% T: transfer entropy (bits)
% nPar: number of partitions
% dimPar: 1-D vector containing the length of each partition (same along all three dimensions)
