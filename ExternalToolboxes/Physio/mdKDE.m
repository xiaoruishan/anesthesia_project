function p=mdKDE(X,xi,bw_coeff)

%%%%%
% This function implements multidimensional kernel density estimation with
% a Gaussian kernel.
%
% Inputs:
% X: data matrix, rows are observations and columns are dimensions.
% xi: coordinates at which joint probabilities are to be estimated, rows are data points and columns are dimensions.
% bw_coeff: multiplier that adjusts the rule of thumb Gaussian bandwidth, a value of 1 means no change in the rule of thumb bandwidth
%
% Output:
% p: joint probability at xi
