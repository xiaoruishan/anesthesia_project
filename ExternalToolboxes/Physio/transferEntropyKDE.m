function T = transferEntropyKDE(X,Y,t,w,N,bw_coeff)

%%%%%
% This function computes the transfer entropy between time series X and Y,
% with the flow of information directed from X to Y. Probability density
% estimation is based on Guassian kernel density estimation.
% 
% For details, please see T Schreiber, "Measuring information transfer", Physical Review Letters, 85(2):461-464, 2000.
%
% Inputs:
% X: source time series in 1-D vector
% Y: target time series in 1-D vector
% t: time lag in X from present
% w: time lag in Y from present
% N: number of equally spaced points along each dimension where probabilities are to be estimated
% bw_coeff: multiplier that adjusts the rule of thumb Gaussian bandwidth, a value of 1 means no change in the rule of thumb bandwidth
%
% Outputs:
% T: transfer entropy (bits)
